## Usage

These extensions are implemented for all types implementing `AsRef<str>`. This covers most of the usual string types,
including `String`, `Cow<str>` and `&str` itself.

## Extensions

### Formatting, cases

‚ùé WIP: not yet implemented, but the underlying word bounding logic is fully implemented and passes
rudimentary tests

### Naming conventions

<details>
<summary>Naming conventions (click to open details)</summary>

We try to follow
the [official rust naming guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html#ad-hoc-conversions-follow-as_-to_-into_-conventions-c-conv),
i.e:

| Prefix | Cost      | Ownership                                                                                     |
|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| as_    | Free      | borrowed -> borrowed                                                                          |
| to_    | Expensive | borrowed -> borrowed <br/>borrowed -> owned (non-Copy types) <br/>owned -> owned (Copy types) |
| into_  | Variable  | owned -> owned (non-Copy types)                                                               |

This means that you can expect the extension methods to follow the official semantics and behave similarly, especially
regarding the cost.

## Performance

This repository contains three different methods to perform word bounds resolution - with standard `regex` crate,
with `fancy_regex` crate, and a custom regexless char-walking version.

The performance of these methods is evaluated using `criterion`
benchmarking library. See [benches/bench_word_bounds.rs](benches/bench_word_bounds.rs) for the benchmarking code and
try it yourself. Here are the latest results on a macbook air m1 (which shows the relational performance, while the
exacts
will of course vary by system etc.):

| Trait                         | Execution Time       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `WordBoundResolverRegex`      | 119.09  ¬µs (average) | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Major WIP** </br>(More) Accurate, but currently ~50x <br/><br/>slower than `no_regex`. Based on prior proof-of-concepts, we should ultimately land at around ~3x slower than the charwalk variant. Suitable for non-critical performance paths. |
| `WordBoundResolverFancyRegex` | 15.433  ¬µs (average) | üöß **WIP, but almost there** </br>All-inclusive regex logic including lookahead/lookback, which should be even more accurate, but ~7x slower than `no_regex`. Use only when other variants fail.                                                     |
| `WordBoundResolverCharwalk`   | 2.4 ¬µs (average)     | ‚ùé **Just needs more optimization** </br>Fastest and simplest, but could fail on certain edge cases. Officially suggested method for common cases.                                                                                                    |

The `criterion` benchmark results show that `WordBoundResolverCharwalk` is the fastest yet simplest method, taking only
about
2.4 ¬µs on average per the benchmarking execution. The regex variants can be more accurate, and their logic is
using a tried and
tested framework, but they are significantly more expensive to run; the `WordBoundResolverRegex` that has no integrated
lookahead/lookback features, replaces this absence with a custom post-process pass, and should be about 3 times slower
than the
`WordBoundResolverCharwalk` variant (‚ö†Ô∏è *but is under construction and while it passes the tests, it's 50x slower at
the moment* ‚ö†Ô∏è). The
`WordBoundResolverFancyRegex` which makes use of the regex
engine for all of
its logic (including
lookahead/lookback), is more than 7 times slower than the `WordBoundResolverCharwalk` variant, though should yield
the most accurate results.

> Note: The regex variants are somewhat optimized, and in addition the crate has two different focuses for
> optimizations with
> the feature flags
`optimize_for_cpu` and
`optimize_for_memory`. This is mostly relevant for someone doing extreme and picky optimizations on a larger project,
> otherwise one should stick to the defaults. The
> default configuration for optimizations bring the heaviest one, `fancy_regex` variant, down from around the 40 micro
> second range to its current ~15 micro second range (with the same system as for the above benchmark results).

The official suggestion is to use `WordBoundResolverCharwalk` (i.e neither `use_regex`
nor `use_fancy_regex` features are enabled),
unless you face an edge case that isn't covered yet in the manual parsing logic. After that, you should test whether
`WordBoundResolverRegex` works, and if not, try `WordBoundResolverFancyRegex`.

> Note: Ultimately the costs are not usually all that significant, since this
> shouldn't be called in any hot loops, but your mileage may vary. Any and all issues and pull requests are welcome,
> if you face an edge case that isn't covered on the `WordBoundResolverCharwalk` variant.
